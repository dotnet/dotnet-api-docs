// Sample for the Environment.TickCount property.

// TickCount cycles between Int32.MinValue, which is a negative
// number, and Int32.MaxValue once every 49.8 days. This sample
// removes the sign bit to yield a nonnegative number that cycles
// between zero and Int32.MaxValue once every 24.9 days.
