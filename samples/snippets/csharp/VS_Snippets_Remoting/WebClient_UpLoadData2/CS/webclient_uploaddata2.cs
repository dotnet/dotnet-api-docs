// System.Net.WebClient.UploadData(String,byte[])
/*
This program demonstrates the 'UploadData(String,byte[])' method of "WebClient" class.
It accepts an Uri and some string content to be posted to the Uri. This string is posted to the Uri 
provided as input using the 'UploadData(String,byte[])' method. The custom made site responds back 
with whatever was posted to it. The contents of the response are displayed to the console.

Note : The results described were obtained using a custom made site. This behavior may not be the
same with all other sites. Also certain sites would not accept "Post" method thereby leading to 
an error. It is advisable to construct a site using files accompanying this and provide
url name of this site to the program.
