// System.Net.WebClient.OpenWrite(String)
/*
This program demonstrates the 'OpenWrite(String)' method of "WebClient" class.
It accepts an Uri and some string content to be posted to the Uri. The
program makes a call to 'OpenWrite(String)' method and obtains a "Stream" instance
This stream is used to post data to the site. 

Note : Behavior of this program may not be the same with all other sites. Also certain 
sites would not accept "Post" method thereby leading to an error. It is advisable 
to construct a site using files accompanying this and provide
url name of this site to the program.
