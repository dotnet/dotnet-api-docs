' Sample for the Environment.TickCount property.
' TickCount cycles between Int32.MinValue, which is a negative 
' number, and Int32.MaxValue once every 49.8 days. This sample
' removes the sign bit to yield a nonnegative number that cycles 
' between zero and Int32.MaxValue once every 24.9 days.

Class Sample
   Public Shared Sub Main()
      Dim result As Integer = Environment.TickCount And Int32.MaxValue

      Console.WriteLine("TickCount: {0}", result)
   End Sub
End Class

'This example produces an output similar to the following:
'
'TickCount: 101931139
