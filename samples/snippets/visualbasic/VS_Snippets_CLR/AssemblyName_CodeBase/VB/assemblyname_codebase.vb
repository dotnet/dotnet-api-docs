' System.Reflection.AssemblyName.FullName
' The following example demonstrates the 'CodeBase', 'CultureInfo'
' 'HashAlgorithm' and 'FullName' properties of the 'AssemblyName' class. 
' Creates a dynamic assembly named 'MyAssembly' with a module named 'MyModule' 
' and a type within the module named 'MyType'. The type 'MyType' has a single' method called 
' 'Main' which is also the entry point to the assembly.
' The creation of the dynamic assembly is carried out by the method called'   'MakeAssembly'. After the assembly is created with the help of 'MakeAssembly''   the assemblies currently loaded are found and the dynamic assembly that we'   have created is searched for, which is displayed to the console. The dynamic'   assembly is also saved to a file named 'MyAssembly.exe'.
' Note : Run 'MyAssembly.exe' which this example has created 
' for a simple 'Hello World!" display.'
