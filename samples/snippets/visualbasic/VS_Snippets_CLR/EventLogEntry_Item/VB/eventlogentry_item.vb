' System.Diagnostics.EventLogEntryCollection.Count
' System.Diagnostics.EventLogEntryCollection.Item

' The following example demonstrates 'Item' and 'Count' properties of 
' EventLogEntryCollection class. A new Source for eventlog 'MyNewLog' is created.
' The program checks if a Event source exists. If the source already exists, it gets 
' the Log name associated with it otherwise, creates a new event source. 
' A new entry is created for 'MyNewLog'.Entries of 'MyNewLog' are obtained and 
' the count and the messages are displayed.
