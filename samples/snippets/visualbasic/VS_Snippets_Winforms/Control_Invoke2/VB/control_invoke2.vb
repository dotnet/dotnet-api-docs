' System.Windows.Forms.Control.Invoke(Delegate);
' <Snippet1>
' The following example demonstrates the 'Invoke(Delegate)' method of 'Control class.
' A 'ListBox' and a 'Button' control are added to a form, containing a delegate
' which encapsulates a method that adds items to the listbox. This function is executed
' on the thread that owns the underlying handle of the form. When user clicks on button
' the above delegate is executed using 'Invoke' method.
