' System.Net.WebResponse.GetResponseStream.

 ' This program demonstrates the 'GetResponseStream' method of the 'WebResponse' class.
'It creates a web request and queries for a response.
'It then gets the response stream. This response stream is piped to a higher level stream
' reader. The reader reads 256 characters at a time, writes them into a string and then displays the
'string in the console
