' System.Net.WebClient.OpenWrite(String,String)

'This program demonstrates the 'OpenWrite(String,String)' method of the "WebClient" class.
'It accepts an Uri and some string content to be posted to the Uri. The
'program makes a call to 'OpenWrite(String,String)' method and obtains a "Stream" instance.
'This stream is used to post data to the site. 
'
'Note: Behavior of this program may not be the same with all other sites. Also certain 
'sites would not accept "Post" method thereby leading to an error. It is advisable 
'to construct a site using files accompanying this and provide
'url name of this site to the program.
