' The following sample is intended to demonstrate how to use a
' TcpListener for synchronous communcation with a TCP client
' It creates a TcpListener that connects to the specified port (13000).
' Any TCP client that wants to use this TcpListener has to explicitly connect 
' to an address obtained by the combination of the server
' on which this TcpListener is running and the port 13000.
' This TcpListener simply echoes back the message sent by the client
' after translating it into uppercase. 
' Refer to the related client in the TcpClient class.
