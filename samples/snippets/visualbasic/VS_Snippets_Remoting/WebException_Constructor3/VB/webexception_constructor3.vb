' This program demonstrates the 'WebException(String,WebExceptionStatus)' constructor of 'WebException' class.
' It creates a 'HttpConnect' object and calls the 'ConnectHttpServer' method with invalid 'URL'.
' When the method tries to establish a socket connection to that address an exception is thrown and 
' in the 'catch' block  a new 'WebException' object is created  and thrown. That exception is caught
' in the calling method and the error message is displayed on the console.
