' The following sample demonstrates the properties 'Ports','Extensions','Name' and
' constructor 'Service()'. This sample reads the contents of a file 'MathService_VB.wsdl'
' into a 'ServiceDescription' instance. It gets the collection of Service 
' instances from 'ServiceDescription'. It then removes a 'Service' from the collection and
' creates a new 'Service' and adds it into collection. It writes a new web service description 
' file 'MathService_New.wsdl'.
