' System.Net.HttpWebResponse.GetResponseStream

' This program demonstrates the 'GetResponseStream' method of the 'HttpWebResponse' class.
' It creates a web request and queries for a response. It then gets the response stream. 
' This response stream is piped to a higher level stream reader. The reader reads 256 characters at a time,
' writes them into a string and then displays the string in the console.
