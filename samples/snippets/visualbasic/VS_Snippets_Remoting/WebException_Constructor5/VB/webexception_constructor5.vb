' System.Net.WebException.WebException(String,InnerException,Status,WebResponse);

' This program demonstrates the 'WebException(String,InnerException,Status,WebResponse)' constructor of
' 'WebException' class.
' A 'HttpConnect' class is defined which extends the 'WebResponse' class.  Then a 'HttpConnect' object is 
' created by taking an uri(intranet) from the user as input and 'ConnectHttpServer' method is called to connect
' the InternetServer at the specified 'URL'. It asks for a file named 'nhjj.htm' ,gets the response from the 
' InternetServer and checks the status of the response. If status is '404 File not Found' a 'WebResponse' object
' is created and then a new 'WebException' object is created and thrown. That exception is caught in the calling
' method and the error message along with the response obtained from the InternetServer is displayed to the 
' console.
