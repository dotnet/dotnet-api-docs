' System.Net.WebClient.UploadValues(String,NameValueCollection)

'This program demonstrates the 'UploadValues(String,NameValueCollection)' method of "WebClient" class.
'It accepts an Uri.Forms a 'NameValueCollection' instance using 
'a set of pre-defined name-value pairs. These are posted to the Uri provided as input using the 
''UploadValues(String,NameValueCollection)'method. The custom made site responds back 
'with whatever was posted to it. This is displayed to the console.
'
'Note : The results described were obtained using a custom made site. This behavior may not be the
'same with all other sites. Also certain sites would not accept "Post" method thereby leading to 
'an error. It is advisable to construct a site using files accompanying this and provide
'url name of this site to the program.
