' System.Net.WebException.WebException(); 

' This program demonstrates the 'WebException()' constructor of 'WebException' class.
' It creates a 'HttpConnect' object and calls the 'ConnectHttpServer' method with an invalid 'URL'.
' When the method tries to establish a socket connection to that address an exception is thrown.In 
' the 'catch' block  a new 'WebException' object is created  and thrown to the caller. That exception 
' is caught in the calling method and the error message is dispalyed to the console.
