' System.Net.WebClient.BaseAddress; System.Net.WebClient.ResponseHeaders

' This program demonstrates the 'BaseAddress' and 'ResponseHeaders' properties of the 'WebClient' class.
' It accepts the base Uri from the user and assigns it to the 'BaseAddress' property of the 
' 'WebClient' class. It then invokes 'DownloadFile' for the specific web page requested by the
' user. WebClient internally combines the 'BaseAddress' and specific page name to retrieve the page.
'
' The 'ResponseHeaders' property is a 'WebHeaderCollection' that contains the
' header information of the response received from the server. This is displayed to the console.
