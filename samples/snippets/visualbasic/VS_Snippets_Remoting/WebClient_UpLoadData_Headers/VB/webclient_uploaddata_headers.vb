' System.Net.WebClient.UploadData(String,String,byte[]); System.Net.WebClient.Headers

'This program demonstrates the 'UploadData(String,String,byte[])' method and 'Headers' property of 
''WebClient' class. It accepts an Uri and some string content to be posted to the Uri. This string 
'is posted to the Uri provided as input using the 'UploadData(String,String,byte[])' method.
'The 'Headers' property is used to set the "Content-Type" header to "application/x-www-form-urlencoded".
'The custom made site responds back with whatever was posted to it. 
'The contents of the response are displayed to the console.
'
'Note : The results described were obtained using a custom made site. This behavior may not be the
'same with all other sites. Also certain sites would not support the "Post" method thereby leading to 
'an error. It is advisable to construct a site using files accompanying this and provide
'url name of this site to the program.
