' System.Web.Services.Description.Service

'   The following sample demonstrates the class 'Service'. This sample reads the
'   contents of a file 'MathService.wsdl' into a 'ServiceDescription' instance. 
'   It gets the collection of Service instances from 'ServiceDescription'. It 
'   then removes a 'Service' from the collection and creates a new 'Service' and 
'   adds it into collection. It writes a new web service description file 'MathService_New.wsdl'.
