' System.Net.WebException.WebException(String);

' This program demonstrates the 'WebException(String)' constructor of 'WebException' class.
' It creates a 'HttpConnect' object and calls the 'ConnectHttpServer' method with invalid 'URL'.
' When the method tries to establish a socket connection to that address an exception is thrown.In 
' the 'catch' block  a new 'WebException' object is created with a message(specific to the present 
' situatuation) and  thrown to the caller. That exception is caught in the calling method and the 
' error message is dispalyed on the console.
