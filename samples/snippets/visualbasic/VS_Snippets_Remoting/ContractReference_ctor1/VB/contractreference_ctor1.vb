' System.Web.Services.Discovery.ContractReference.ContractReference(string)

' The following example demonstrates the constructor 'ContractReference(string)' 
' of 'ContractReference' class. A 'DiscoveryDocument' object is created . The 
' constructor initializes a new instance of 'ContractReference' using the supplied 
' reference to a Service Description. The Contract reference object is added to the list 
' of references contained within the discovery document. A '.disco' file is generated
' for the webservice, where the reference tags of ContractReference are reflected.
