' The following example demonstrates the usage of the 'OperationBinding'
' class, the 'OperationBinding()' constructor, and various properties of the class. The
' input to the program is a WSDL file 'MathService_input_cs.wsdl' without the
' add operation binding for SOAP protocol. In the example, the WSDL file is modified to insert
' a new 'OperationBinding' instance for SOAP. The 'OperationBinding' instance
' is populated based on WSDL document structure defined in WSDL specification. The updated
' instance is then written to 'MathService_new_cs.wsdl'.
