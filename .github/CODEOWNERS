# Lines starting with '#' are comments.
# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.

# More details are here: https://help.github.com/articles/about-codeowners/

# The '*' pattern is for global owners.
# Not adding in this PR, but I'd like to try adding a global owner set with the entire team.
# One interpretation of the GitHub docs is that global owners are added only if not removed
# by a more local rule.

# Order is important. The last matching pattern has the most precedence.
# The folders are ordered as follows:

# In each subsection folders are order first by depth, then alphabetically.
# This should make it easy to add new rules without breaking existing ones.
