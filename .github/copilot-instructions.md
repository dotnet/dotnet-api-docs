Code comments should end with a period.

When you add a code snippet to the XML remarks of an API, add the code as a separate code file (.cs file) and not as an inline (```) code block. Also add a .csproj file to compile the code if one doesn't already exist in the snippet folder.

Don't use the word "may". Use "might" to indicate possibility or "can" to indicate permission.

There should always be a comma before a clause that begins with "which".

Use a conversational tone with contractions.

Be concise.

Break up long sentences.

Use the present tense for instructions and descriptions. For example, "The method returns a value" instead of "The method will return a value."

Use the Oxford comma in lists of three or more items.
