## Remarks  
 Plug-in serializers can only be used with full trust applications.  
  
 When called by the application, the plug-in serializer runs in the same thread as the application and can only access elements created within the application thread.  When designing a custom plug-in serializer, it is important to properly handle all possible error conditions. A failure within a plug-in serializer can cause an application to fail.
