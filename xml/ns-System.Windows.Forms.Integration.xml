## Remarks  
 The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Integration> namespace contains classes that enable interoperation between the [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winforms](~/includes/tlasharptla-winforms-md.md)] and WPF technologies. When you use <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Integration> classes, you can host [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winforms](~/includes/tlasharptla-winforms-md.md)] controls on WPF pages, and WPF elements in [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winforms](~/includes/tlasharptla-winforms-md.md)]-based applications.  
  
 The two key classes that implement interoperation capabilities are <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Integration.WindowsFormsHost> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Integration.ElementHost>. Which class you use depends on your control implementation:  
  
-   Use the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Integration.WindowsFormsHost> class when you must use a [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winforms](~/includes/tlasharptla-winforms-md.md)] control on a WPF page.  
  
-   Use the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Integration.ElementHost> class when you must use a WPF element in a [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winforms](~/includes/tlasharptla-winforms-md.md)]-based application.
