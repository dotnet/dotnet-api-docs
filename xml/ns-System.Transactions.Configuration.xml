## Examples
 An example configuration file used by your transaction application can be as follows,

 `<configuration>`

 `<system.transactions>`

 `<defaultSettings distributedTransactionManagerName="F04M25" timeout="02:00:00"/>`

 `<machineSettings maxTimeout="02:00:00"/>`

 `</system.transactions>`

 `</configuration>`

 This example specifies the default values of a transaction. Specifically, it sets the computer name of the Distributed Transaction Coordinator (MSDTC) that is responsible for coordinating all distributed transactions started locally, and the default time after which a transaction times out. In addition, it specifies a setting that can only be modified at the machine level, which is the maximum amount of time allowed before a transaction times out.
