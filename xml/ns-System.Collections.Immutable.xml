## Remarks

With immutable collections, you can:

- Share a collection in a way that its consumer can be assured that the collection never changes.
- Provide implicit thread safety in multi-threaded applications (no locks required to access collections).
- Follow functional programming practices.
- Modify a collection during enumeration, while ensuring that the original collection does not change.

The immutable collection classes are available as part of the core .NET libraries, however they're not part of the core class library distributed with .NET Framework. For .NET Framework 4.6.2 and later apps, the classes are available through NuGet packages.
