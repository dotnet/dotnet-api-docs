<Namespace Name="System.Diagnostics.Metrics">
  <Docs>
    <summary>Metrics are numerical measurements reported over time, most often used to monitor the health of an application and generate alerts. For example a web service might track how many requests it receives each second, how many milliseconds it took to respond, and how many of the responses sent an error back to the user. These metrics can be reported to a monitoring system at frequent regular intervals. The System.Diagnostics.Metrics namespace can be used to add metrics to an application. The APIs work on all platforms supported by .NET and were designed to integrate well with OpenTelemetry's (https://opentelemetry.io/) growing ecosystem of tools. They also integrate with dotnet SDK tools like dotnet-counters (https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/diagnostics/dotnet-counters) and has a listener API available for developers that want to create custom tooling or adapters to other systems.</summary>
