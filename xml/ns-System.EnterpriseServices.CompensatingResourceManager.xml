    <summary>Provides classes that allow you to use a Compensating Resource Manager (CRM) in managed code. A CRM is a service provided by COM+ that enables you to include nontransactional objects in Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator (DTC) transactions. Although CRMs do not provide the capabilities of a full resource manager, they do provide transactional atomicity (all or nothing behavior) and durability through the recovery log.</summary>
