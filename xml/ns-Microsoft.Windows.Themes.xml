    <summary>Provides exposure to the set of themes defined by Windows Presentation Foundation. In WPF, a theme is a set of resources, defined at the system level, which provide the default appearance for controls and other visual elements of an application. WPF themes are created using styles and include Luna, Aero, Royale, and Classic. Only the client area of a WPF application uses these themes; the appearance of the window border and buttons that form the window chrome is controlled by the Win32 theme service.</summary>
