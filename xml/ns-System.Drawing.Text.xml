## Remarks
 Basic graphics functionality is provided by the <xref:System.Drawing> namespace. The classes in this namespace allow users to create and use collections of fonts.

> [!CAUTION]
>  Classes within the <xref:System.Drawing.Text> namespace are not supported for use within a Windows or ASP.NET service. Attempting to use these classes from within one of these application types may produce unexpected problems, such as diminished service performance and run-time exceptions.
