## Remarks
 The classes in this namespace provide a way to use caching facilities like those in ASP.NET, but without a dependency on the `System.Web` assembly.

> [!NOTE]
>  The output caching functionality and types in the <xref:System.Runtime.Caching> namespace were introduced in .NET Framework 4.

 The caching types that are provided in this namespace offer the following features:

-   Caching is accessible to all .NET applications (not just ASP.NET).

-   Caching is extensible.

-   You can create custom caching providers. For example, instead of using the default in-memory cache engine, you can create custom providers that store cache data in databases, in custom objects, or in the file system.
