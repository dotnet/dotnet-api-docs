[!INCLUDE[drawing](~/includes/drawing.md)]

 The <xref:System.Drawing.Imaging.Metafile> class provides methods for recording and saving metafiles. The <xref:System.Drawing.Imaging.Encoder> class enables users to extend GDI+ to support any image format. The <xref:System.Drawing.Imaging.PropertyItem> class provides methods for storing and retrieving metadata in image files.

> [!CAUTION]
>  Classes within the <xref:System.Drawing.Imaging> namespace are not supported for use within a Windows or ASP.NET service. Attempting to use these classes from within one of these application types may produce unexpected problems, such as diminished service performance and run-time exceptions.
