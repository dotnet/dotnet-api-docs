## Remarks
 Entity Data Model tools use the conceptual model file to generate data classes that derive from classes in this namespace. For more information, see [Object Services Overview (Entity Framework)](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/bb386871(v=vs.100)). Custom data classes can inherit from classes in this namespace. The <xref:System.Data.Objects.DataClasses> namespace also includes interfaces that are used to implement custom data classes without inheriting from Entity Framework classes. For more information, see [Customizing Objects](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/dotnet/netframework-4.0/bb738612(v=vs.100)).
