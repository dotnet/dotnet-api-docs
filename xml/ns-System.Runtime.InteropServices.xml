## Remarks  
 Members of this namespace provide several categories of functionality, as shown in the following table. Attributes control marshaling behavior, such as how to arrange structures or how to represent strings. The most important attributes are <xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.DllImportAttribute>, which you use to define platform invoke methods for accessing unmanaged APIs, and <xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.MarshalAsAttribute>, which you use to specify how data is marshaled between managed and unmanaged memory.
