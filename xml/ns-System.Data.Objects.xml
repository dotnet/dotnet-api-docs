    <summary>The <see cref="N:System.Data.Objects" /> namespace includes classes that provide access to the core functionality of Object Services. These classes enable you to query, insert, update, and delete data by working with strongly typed CLR objects that are instances of entity types. Object Services supports both Language-Integrated Query (LINQ) and Entity SQL queries against types that are defined in an Entity Data Model (EDM). Object Services materializes the returned data as objects and propagates object changes back to the data source. It also provides facilities for tracking changes, binding objects to controls, and handling concurrency.
