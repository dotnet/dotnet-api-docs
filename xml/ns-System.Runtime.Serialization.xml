    <summary>Contains classes that can be used for serializing and deserializing objects. Serialization is the process of converting an object or a graph of objects into a linear sequence of bytes for either storage or transmission to another location. Deserialization is the process of taking in stored information and recreating objects from it.</summary>

## Remarks
 The <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.ISerializable> interface provides a way for classes to control their own serialization behavior. Classes in the <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters> namespace control the actual formatting of various data types encapsulated in the serialized objects.

 Formatters that serialize and deserialize objects to and from a particular format can be found in the <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters> namespace.
