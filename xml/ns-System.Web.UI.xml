## Remarks
 This namespace includes the <xref:System.Web.UI.Control> class, which provides a common set of functionality for all server controls, which includes HTML server controls, Web server controls, and user controls. It also includes the <xref:System.Web.UI.Page> class. This class is generated automatically whenever a request is made for an .aspx file in an ASP.NET Web application. You can inherit from both of these classes.

 The namespace also includes classes that provide the server controls with data-binding functionality, the ability to save the view state of a given control or page, and parsing functionality.
