/* This example produces output similar to the following:

Press Enter to create three threads and start them.
The threads wait on AutoResetEvent #1, which was created
in the signaled state, so the first thread is released.
This puts AutoResetEvent #1 into the unsignaled state.

Thread_1 waits on AutoResetEvent #1.
Thread_1 is released from AutoResetEvent #1.
Thread_1 waits on AutoResetEvent #2.
Thread_3 waits on AutoResetEvent #1.
Thread_2 waits on AutoResetEvent #1.
Press Enter to release another thread.

Thread_3 is released from AutoResetEvent #1.
Thread_3 waits on AutoResetEvent #2.
Press Enter to release another thread.

Thread_2 is released from AutoResetEvent #1.
Thread_2 waits on AutoResetEvent #2.

All threads are now waiting on AutoResetEvent #2.
Press Enter to release a thread.

Thread_2 is released from AutoResetEvent #2.
Thread_2 ends.
Press Enter to release a thread.

Thread_1 is released from AutoResetEvent #2.
Thread_1 ends.
Press Enter to release a thread.

Thread_3 is released from AutoResetEvent #2.
Thread_3 ends.
