Before you first build this project in the visual Studio IDE, you must run the
build command from the command prompt while in this (or the parent) directory.

The build command builds the .dll project that is needed by this project
and drops the .dll in this project folder. The .dll project itself
could have been included as part of solution but the .dll project doesn't
build from the IDE.
