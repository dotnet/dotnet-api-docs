T:System.Runtime.Caching.Hosting.IApplicationIdentifier
Defines an identifier for application domains that a cache 
implementation can use to interact with a host environment. 
public interface IApplicationIdentifier
Remarks
A dnprdnshort host environment such as ASP.NET can use the 
T:System.Runtime.Caching.Hosting.IApplicationIdentifier 
interface to define strings that identify individual 
application domains. The host environment implements 
the T:System.Runtime.Caching.Hosting.IApplicationIdentifier 
interface. This interface is then available to 
T:System.Runtime.Caching.ObjectCache implementations 
through the P:System.Runtime.Caching.ObjectCache.Host property. 
A cache implementation uses this reference to obtain
 an identifier for the application domain. 
In ASP.NET, cache implementations 
use the application identifier to construct 
identifiers for cache performance counters. 
This provides names for performance counter 
instances that can be distinguished between application domains 
when multiple application domains are running. 
Example

 
M:System.Runtime.Caching.Hosting.IApplicationIdentifier.GetApplicationId
Gets an identifier for an application domain. 
string GetApplicationId();
Return Value
A unique identifier for the current application domain. 
Remarks
The M:System.Runtime.Caching.Hosting.IApplicationIdentifier.GetApplicationId method is 
typically implemented by a dnprdnshort host environment in order to construct 
an application identifier for an T:System.Runtime.Caching.ObjectCache 
implementation. A T:System.Runtime.Caching.ObjectCache implementation 
uses this information to identify the application domain that is 
currently running. 
For example, in ASP.NET, the cache uses an application identifier 

to construct identifiers for cache performance counters. The cache 
calls the M:System.Runtime.Caching.Hosting.IApplicationIdentifier.
GetApplicationId method that is implemented by the host environment
 and the host returns the identifier. This provides names for 
performance counter instances that can be distinguished between 
application domains when multiple application domains are running.
