' Use this code inside a project created with the Visual Basic > Windows Desktop > Console Application template. 
' Replace the default code in Module1.vb with this code. Then right click the project in Solution Explorer, 
' select Properties, and set the Startup Object to Timer1. 

' To avoid confusion with other Timer classes, this sample always uses the fully-qualified
' name of System.Timers.Timer.

Public Class Module1

    Private Shared aTimer As System.Timers.Timer

        ' Normally, the timer is declared at the class level, so that it stays in scope as long as it
        ' is needed. If the timer is declared in a long-running method, KeepAlive must be used to prevent
        ' the JIT compiler from allowing aggressive garbage collection to occur before the method ends.
        ' You can experiment with this by commenting out the class-level declaration and uncommenting 
        ' the declaration below; then uncomment the GC.KeepAlive(aTimer) at the end of the method.        
        'Dim aTimer As System.Timers.Timer 

        ' Create a timer and set a two second interval.

        ' Alternate method: create a Timer with an interval argument to the constructor.
        ' aTimer = New System.Timers.Timer(2000)

        ' Hook up the Elapsed event for the timer.  
        AddHandler aTimer.Elapsed, AddressOf OnTimedEvent
