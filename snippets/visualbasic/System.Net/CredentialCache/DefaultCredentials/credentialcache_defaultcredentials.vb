' System.Net.CredentialCache.DefaultCredentials.

 ' This program demonstrates the 'DefaultCredentials' property of the 'CredentialCache' 
'   class.
'   Creates an 'HttpWebRequest' object to access the local Uri "http://localhost"(IIS documentation start page)
'   Assigns the static property 'DefaultCredentials' of 'CredentialCache' as 'Credentials' for the 'HttpWebRequest'
'   object. DefaultCredentials returns the system credentials for the current security context in which 
'   the application is running. For a client-side application, these are usually the Windows credentials 
'   (user name, password, and domain) of the user running the application.
'   These credentials are used internally to authenticate the request.
'   The html contents of the start page are displayed to the console. 
'
'Note: Make sure that "Windows Authentication" has been set as  Directory Security settings
'      for default web site in IIS  
'
