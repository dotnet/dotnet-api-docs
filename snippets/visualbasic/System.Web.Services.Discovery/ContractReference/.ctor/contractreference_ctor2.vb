' System.Web.Services.Discovery.ContractReference.ContractReference(string,string)

'  The following example demonstrates the constructor 'ContractReference(string,string)' 
'  of 'ContractReference' class. In this example the 'ContractReference' class constructor
'  initializes a new instance of the 'ContractReference' class using the supplied references
'  to a service description and a XML Web service implementing the service description.The
'  Contract reference object is added to the list of references contained within the 
'  discovery document and a '.disco' file is generated for the webservice where the 
'  reference tags of ContractReference are reflected.
