' System.web.Services.Discovery.DiscoveryClientProtocol.Errors

' The following example demonstrates the usage of the 'Errors' property
' of the class 'DiscoveryClientProtocol'. The input to the program is
' a discovery file 'MathService_vb.vsdisco', which holds reference 
' related to 'MathService_vb.asmx' web service. The program is 
' excecuted first time with existence of the file 
' 'MathService_vb.asmx' in the location as specified in the discovery
' file. The file 'MathService_vb.asmx' is removed from the referred 
' location in a way to simulate a scenario wherein the file related 
' to web service is missing, and the program is excecuted the second time
' to show the exception occuring.
Option Strict On
