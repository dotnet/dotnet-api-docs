' System.Diagnostics.EventLog.WriteEntry(String,EventLogEntryType,Int32,Int16,Byte[])

' The following sample demonstrates the 
' 'WriteEntry(String, EventLogEntryType, Int32, Int16, Byte[])' method of 
' 'EventLog' class. It writes an entry to a custom event log, "MyLog".
' It creates the source "MySource" if the source does not already exist.
' It creates an 'EventLog' object and calls 'WriteEntry' passing the 
' description, Log entry type, application specific identifier for the event,
' application specific subcategory and  data to be associated with the entry.
