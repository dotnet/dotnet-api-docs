' *
' * Description: 
' * 
' * The sample is shows how to implement UI Automation providers for the elements 
' * of a fragment that is hosted in an HWND. The control itself has been kept 
' * simple. It does not support scrolling and therefore an arbitrary limit has 
' * been set on the number of items it can contain.
' * 
' * The fragment consists of the root element (a list box) and its children (the 
' * list items.) The UI Automation provider for the list box supports only one 
' * control pattern, the Selection pattern. The provider for the list items 
' * implements the SelectionItem pattern.
' *
' * To see the UI Automation provider at work, run the application and then open 
' * UI Spy. You can see the application and its controls in the Control View. 
' * Clicking on the control or on the list items in the UI Spy tree causes the 
' * provider's methods to be called, and the values returned are displayed in the 
' * Properties pane. (Note that some values are retrieved from the default HWND
' * provider, not this custom implementation.) You can also select an item in the 
' * list by using the SelectionItem control pattern in UI Spy.
