   '  This sample shows how to support code generation for a custom type 
   '  of object using a type converter and InstanceDescriptor objects.
   '
   '  To use this code, copy it to a file and add the file to a project.  
   '  Then add a component to the project and declare a Triangle field and 
   '  a public property with accessors for the Triangle field on the component.
   '
   '  The Triangle property will be persisted using code generation.
