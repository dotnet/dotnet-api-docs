' This example contains an IRootDesigner that implements the IToolboxUser interface.
' This example demonstrates how to enable the GetToolSupported method of an IToolboxUser
' designer in order to disable specific toolbox items, and how to respond to the 
' invocation of a ToolboxItem in the ToolPicked method of an IToolboxUser implementation.
' This example component class demonstrates the associated IRootDesigner which 
' implements the IToolboxUser interface. When designer view is invoked, Visual 
' Studio .NET attempts to display a design mode view for the class at the top 
' of a code file. This can sometimes fail when the class is one of multiple types 
' in a code file, and has a DesignerAttribute associating it with an IRootDesigner. 
' Placing a derived class at the top of the code file solves this problem. A 
' derived class is not typically needed for this reason, except that placing the 
' RootDesignedComponent class in another file is not a simple solution for a code 
' example that is packaged in one segment of code.
