 ' System.Reflection.AssemblyName.AssemblyName()
' System.Reflection.AssemblyName.Name
' System.Reflection.AssemblyName.Version
' The following example demonstrates the constructor 'AssemblyName()' and
' the 'Name' and 'Version' properties of the 'AssemblyName' class.
' Creates a dynamic assembly named 'MyAssembly' with a module named 'MyModule' and
' a type within the module named 'MyType'. The type 'MyType' has a single' 
' method called 'Main' which is also the entry point to the assembly.
' The creation of the dynamic assembly is carried out by the method called 'MakeAssembly'. 
' After the assembly is created with the help of 'MakeAssembly''the assemblies currently loaded 
' are found and the dynamic assembly that we have created is searched for, which is displayed to the console. 
' The dynamic assembly is also saved to a file named 'MyAssembly.exe'.
' Note : Run 'MyAssembly.exe' which this example has created for a simple 'Hello World!" display.'
