' System.Web.Services.Description.SoapHeaderBinding

'  The following example demonstrates the class 'SoapHeaderBinding'.
'  It takes as input a wsdl file. By using the 'Read' method 
'  of 'ServiceDescription' class it gets a 'ServiceDescription' object. 
'  It uses the SOAP protocol related classes  and  creates 'Binding' element
'  of 'SOAP' protocol which are then added to the 'ServiceDescription' object.
'  An output wsdl file is generated from 'ServiceDescription' object which 
'  could be used for generating a proxy.
