' System.Web.Services.Description.ServiceDescription.Bindings

' The following example demonstrates the property 'Bindings' of 
' 'ServiceDescription' class. The input to the program is a WSDL file 
' 'MyWsdl_VB.wsdl'. This program removes one 'Binding' from the existing WSDL.
' A new Binding is defined and added to the ServiceDescription object.
' The program generates a new Web Service Description document.
