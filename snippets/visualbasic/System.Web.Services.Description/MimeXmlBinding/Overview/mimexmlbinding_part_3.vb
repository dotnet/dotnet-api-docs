' The following program demonstrates constructor and 'Part'property
' of 'MimeXmlBinding' class. This program takes 'MimeXmlBinding_Part_3_Input_VB.wsdl'
' as input, which does not contain 'Binding' object that supports 'HttpPost'.
' It sets message part property to 'Body' on which 'MimeXmlBinding' is 
' applied and finally writes into 'MimeXmlBinding_Part_3_Output_VB.wsdl'.
