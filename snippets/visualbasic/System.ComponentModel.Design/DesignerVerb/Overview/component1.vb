'  This sample demonstrates a designer that adds menu commands
'   to the design-time shortcut menu for a component.
'
'   To test this sample, build the code for the component as a class library, 
'   add the resulting component to the toolbox, open a form in design mode, 
'   and drag the component from the toolbox onto the form. 
'
'   The component should appear in the component tray beneath the form. 
'   Right-click the component.  The verbs should appear in the shortcut menu.
