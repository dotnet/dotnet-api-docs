'   This sample uses the ServiceContainer class, which implements 
'   the IServiceContainer interface.  It creates a service container 
'   and stores services of type Control in it.

'   When the application is run, it adds control services at two
'   times:  when button2 is clicked and when a radio button is
'   clicked.  It adds the controls to the container by calling each
'   of two overloaded versions of IServiceContainer.AddService().
'
'   Pressing button1 invokes the button1 handler, which is
'   button1_Click().  In turn, this invokes a method based on
'   whether or not button2 or a radio button has been selected.
'   If one of these two button types has been selected, then its
'   service has been added to the service container.  In this case,
'   button1_Click() gets the current service, which invokes the
'   method that was associated with this service when the service
'   was added to the container.  If a radio button is current, the
'   system updates the text of that radio button with the given text.
'   If button2 is current, the system calls CreateNewControl(), which
'   creates a new control with the given text.
'
'   Pressing button2 invokes the button2 handler, which adds a service
'   to the container by passing in a service creator callback.  This
'   enables this action to invoke the event handler that the developer
'   specifies.  In this case, the sample invokes CreateNewControl(),
'   which creates and maintains label controls, and displays them in
'   the same group box that the buttons are in.
'
'   Clicking a radio button has the effect of adding that radio button
'   to the service container.
