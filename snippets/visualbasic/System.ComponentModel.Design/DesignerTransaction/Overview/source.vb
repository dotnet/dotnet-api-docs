'   This sample demonstrates how to perform a series of actions in a designer 
'   transaction, how to change values of properties of a component from a 
'   designer, and how to complete transactions without being interrupted 
'   by other activities.

'   To run this sample, add this code to a class library project and compile. 
'   Create a new Windows Forms project or load a form in the designer. Add a 
'   reference to the class library that was compiled in the first step.
'   Right-click the Toolbox in design mode and click Customize Toolbox.  
'   Browse to the class library that was compiled in the first step and 
'   select OK until the DTComponent item appears in the Toolbox.  Add an 
'   instance of this component to the form.  

'   When the component is created and added to the component tray for your
'   design project, the Initialize method of the designer is called. 
'   This method displays a message box informing you that designer transaction
'   event handlers are being registered unless you click Cancel. When you set 
'   properties in the properties window, each change will be encapsulated in 
'   a designer transaction, allowing the change to be undone later.  

'   When you right-click the component, the shortcut menu for the component 
'   is displayed. The designer constructs this menu according to whether 
'   designer transaction notifications are enabled, and offers the option
'   of enabling or disabling the notifications, depending on the current 
'   mode. The shortcut menu also presents a Perform Example Transaction 
'   item which will set the values of the component's StringProperty and 
'   CountProperty properties. You can undo the last designer transaction using 
'   the Undo command provided by the Visual Studio development environment.
