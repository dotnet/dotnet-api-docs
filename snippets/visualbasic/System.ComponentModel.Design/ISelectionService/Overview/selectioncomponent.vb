'  This sample demonstrates using the ISelectionService
'  interface to receive notification of selection change events.  

'  The SelectionComponent control attempts to retrieve an instance 
'  of the ISelectionService when it is sited. If it can, it attaches 
'  event handlers for events provided by the service that display
'  a message when a component is selected or deselected.
'  To run this sample, add the SelectionComponent control to a Form and
'  then select or deselect components in design mode to see the behavior 
'  of the component change event handlers.
