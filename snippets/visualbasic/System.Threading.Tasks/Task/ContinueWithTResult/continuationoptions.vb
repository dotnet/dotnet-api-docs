Module ContuationOptionsDemo
    ' Demonstrated features:
    '   TaskContinuationOptions
    '   Task.ContinueWith()
    '   Task.Factory
    '   Task.Wait()
    ' Expected results:
    '   This sample demonstrates branched continuation sequences - Task+Commit or Task+Rollback.
    '   Notice that no if statements are used.
    '   The first sequence is successful - tran1 and commitTran1 are executed. rollbackTran1 is canceled.
    '   The second sequence is unsuccessful - tran2 and rollbackTran2 are executed. tran2 is faulted, and commitTran2 is canceled.
