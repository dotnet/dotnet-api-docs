        ' In order to create a method to handle the Elapsed event,
        ' it is necessary to know the signature of the delegate 
        ' used to raise the event. Reflection.Emit can then be
        ' used to construct a dynamic class with a static method
        ' that has the correct signature.
        '
        ' Get the event handler type of the Elapsed event. This is
        ' a delegate type, so it has an Invoke method that has
        ' the same signature as the delegate. The following code
        ' creates an array of Type objects that represent the 
        ' parameter types of the Invoke method.

        ' unit smaller than the source array in order to get an array
