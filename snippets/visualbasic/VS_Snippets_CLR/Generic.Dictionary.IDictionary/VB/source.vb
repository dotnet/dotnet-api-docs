' Do not use snippets 31 & 32 with snippet 21; snippet 21 goes 
' with snippet 2, which already provides enough context. (2 and
' 21 were originally one snippet, but had to be split when 31 
' was added, because I don't trust overlapping snippets any
' more.) 
'
' Note further that {2, 21} is NOT USED right now because
' the complete sample (snippet 1) is located in IDictionary.Add.
' 
' The groups are:
' {2, 21} - Add
' {31, 3, 4, 32} - Item
' {31, 6, 32} - Contains
' {31, 7, 32} - GetEnumerator
' {31, 8, 7, 32} - Values
' {31, 9, 7, 32} - Keys
' {31, 10, 32} - Remove
