' System.Configuration.Install.InstallEventArgs
' System.Configuration.Install.InstallEventArgs.InstallEventArgs()
' System.Configuration.Install.InstallEventArgs.InstallEventArgs(IDictionary)
' System.Configuration.Install.InstallEventArgs.SavedState

' The following example demonstrates the 'InstallEventArgs()' and 
' 'InstallEventArgs(IDictionary)' constructors and the 'SavedState'
' property of the 'InstallEventArgs' property. There are two new
' events called 'BeforeCommit' and 'AfterCommit'. The handlers of
' these events are invoked from the protected methods named 'OnBeforeCommit'
' and 'OnAfterCommit' respectively. These events are raised when the 
' 'Commit' method is called.

' Note : 
' a) The two events named 'BeforeCommit' and 'AfterCommit' are added 
' only for example purposes, since there are already
' events named 'Committing' and 'Committed' which perform the same
' function. This example can be made a basis for a new stage being
' added to the already existing four stages namely 'Install', 'Commit',
' 'Rollback' and 'Uninstall'.

' b) Run the example with the help of InstallUtil.exe
'    InstallUtil InstallEventArgs.exe
