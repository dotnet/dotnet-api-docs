'  System.TypeLoadException.TypeName;System.TypeLoadException.Message
'  This program demonstrates the 'TypeName' and 'Message' properties
'  of the 'TypeLoadException' class. It attempts to load a non-existent
'  type from the mscorlib assembly which throws an exception. This 
'  exception is caught and the TypeName and Message values are displayed.

Public Class Example
   Public Shared Sub Main()
      ' Get a reference to the assembly mscorlib.dll, which is always
      ' loaded. (System.String is defined in mscorlib.)
      Dim tString As Type = GetType(String)
      Dim mscorlib As [Assembly] = tString.Assembly

      Try
         Console.WriteLine("Attempting to load a type that does not exist in mscorlib.")
         ' The boolean parameter causes an exception to be thrown if the
         ' type is not found.
         Dim myType As Type = mscorlib.GetType("System.NonExistentType", True)
      Catch ex As TypeLoadException
         ' Display the name of the type that was not found, and the 
         ' exception message.
         Console.WriteLine("TypeLoadException was caught. Type = '{0}'.", _
             ex.TypeName)
         Console.WriteLine("Error Message = '{0}'", ex.Message)

' This example produces output similar to the following:

'Attempting to load a type that does not exist in mscorlib.
'TypeLoadException was caught. Type = 'System.NonExistentType'
'Error Message = 'Could not load type System.NonExistentType from assembly mscorl
