'  The following example demonstrates the 'Action', 'Client', 'MethodInfo', 
'  'OneWay' and 'Url' properties of the 'SoapClientMessage' class. 
'  It extends the 'SoapExtension' class to create a class that is used to 
'  log the SOAP messages transferred for a web service method invocation. 
'  To associate this 'SoapExtension' class with the web service method on 
'  the client proxy, a class that extends from 'SoapExtensionAttribute' is 
'  used. This 'SoapExtensionAttribute' is applied to a client proxy method 
'  which is associated with a web service method. Whenever this method is 
'  invoked on the client side all the SOAP message that get transfered both
'  from the client and the server(which is hosting the web service) are 
'  written into a log file.
