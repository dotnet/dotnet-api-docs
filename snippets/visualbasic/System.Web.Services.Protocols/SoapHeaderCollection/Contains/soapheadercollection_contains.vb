' The following example demonstrates the methods 'Contains','IndexOf' and 
' 'Remove' and the property 'Item' of the 'SoapHeaderCollection' class. The 
' program extends the 'SoapExtension' class to create a class that is 
' used to log the SOAP messages transferred for a web service method 
' invocation. Whenever this method is invoked on the client side 
' all the SOAP message that get transfered both from the client
' and the server are written into a log file.
