<!-- 
This example demonstrates implementing the soft sign-in authentication approach. 
In order for the example to work, the following requirements must be met. 
You can find details on these requirements in the Passport SDK documentation.

1. You must modify the Web.config file associated with this page so that 
authentication mode is set to "Passport".
2. You must have the Passport SDK installed.
3. You must have a Passport Site ID for the site where your page resides. 
If your Site ID is in the PREP environment, you will also need a PREP Passport.
4. You must have installed the encryption key you received after registering your 
site and receiving a site ID.
5. You must have the Passport Manager object settings correctly configured for your site.
