'    System.Web.UI.TemplateControl.OnAbortTransaction;System.Web.UI.TemplateControl.OnCommitTransaction;
'    System.Web.UI.TemplateControl.AbortTransaction;System.Web.UI.TemplateControl.CommitTransaction

'   The following example demonstrates the methods 'OnAbortTransaction','OnCommitTransaction' and
'   events 'AbortTransaction' and 'CommitTransaction' of class 'TemplateControl'.
   
'   Note that since 'TemplateControl' is abstract,this example uses 'Page' class which derives from 'TemplateControl'
'   class. When the page load event occurs two event handlers are added to handle the  'AbortTransaction' and 
'   'CommitTransaction' events raised by  'OnAbortTransaction'  and 'OnCommitTransaction' methods respectively.
'   Account is a dummy class that supports a Debit operation which is transactional and has to execute as 
'   an atomic operation. If any exception is raised during this operation the transaction is aborted.

     public class Account 

   Sub New()

   End Sub
           
   
   public Sub Debit(Amount As Integer) 
   
      ' Do some database work. Any exception thrown here aborts the transaction; 
      ' otherwise, transaction commits.
      
      ' Some error occurred, throw an exception.
      throw new Exception()
      ' Comment the above line of code to commit the transaction.
   End Sub
   End Class
