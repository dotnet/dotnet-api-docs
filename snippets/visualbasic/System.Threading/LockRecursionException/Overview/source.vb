' This code example produces output similar to the following:
'
'Acquire the reader lock.
'
'Attempt to acquire the reader lock recursively:
'LockRecursionException: Recursive read lock acquisitions not allowed in this mode.
'
'Attempt to acquire the writer lock recursively:
'LockRecursionException: Write lock may not be acquired with read lock held. This pattern is prone to deadlocks. Consider using the upgrade lock.
