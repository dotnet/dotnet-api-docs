'  This sample illustrates how to use the IComponentChangeService interface 
'    to handle component change events.  The ComponentClass control attaches 
'    event handlers when it is sited in a document, and displays a message 
'    when notification that a component has been added, removed, or changed
'    is received from the IComponentChangeService.

'    To run this sample, add the ComponentClass control to a Form and
'    add, remove, or change components to see the behavior of the
'    component change event handlers.
