'   This sample illustrates how to use the ISelectionService
'   interface to handle selection change events.  The ComponentClass
'   control attaches event handlers when it is sited in a document
'   that displays a message when a component is selected or deselected.

'   To run this sample, add the ComponentClass control to a Form and
'   then select and deselect the component to see the behavior of the
'   selection change event handlers.
