' The purpose of this snippet is to demonstrate how to use all the primary virtual-mode events. 
' Additionally, this example implements row-level commit-scope. To experiment with this feature,
' make some edits in multiple cells within a single row, then click ESC once to revert the edit
' for a single cell, and twice to revert the edit for the entire row. You can commit all edits 
' for a row without changing focus by pressing CTRL-ENTER.
