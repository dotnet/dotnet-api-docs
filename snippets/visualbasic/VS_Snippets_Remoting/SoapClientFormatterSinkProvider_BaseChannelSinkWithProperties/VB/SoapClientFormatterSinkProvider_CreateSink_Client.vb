' System.Runtime.Remoting.Channels.SoapClientFormatterSinkProvider.CreateSink
' System.Runtime.Remoting.Channels.BaseChannelSinkWithProperties

' The following example demonstrates the 'BaseChannelSinkWithProperties'
' class and 'CreateSink' method of 'SoapClientFormatterSinkProvider' class.
' Custom client formatter provider is defined by implementing
' the 'IClientChannelSinkProvider' interface and custom channel sink is
' defined by inheriting 'BaseChannelSinkWithProperties' abstract class.
' The sink provider chain has the custom sink provider and 
' 'SoapClientFormatterSinkProvider'. The 'CreateSink' method is used to 
' return a sink to the caller and form the sink chain which is used to process
' the message being passed through it.
