' The following example demonstrates the constructor, 'Message' , 'Part'
' and 'Use' properties of the class 'SoapHeaderBinding'.
' It takes as input a wsdl file. The binding element corresponding to 
' SOAP protocol is removed from the input file. By using the 'Read' method 
' of 'ServiceDescription' class it gets a 'ServiceDescription' object. 
' It uses the SOAP protocol related classes  and  creates 'Binding' element
' of 'SOAP' protocol which are then added to the 'ServiceDescription' object.
' An output wsdl file is generated from 'ServiceDescription' object which 
' could be used for generating a proxy.
