' The following example demonstrates various members of the 
' SoapHeaderCollection class and the In member of the SoapHeaderDirection
' enumeration. The program extends the SoapExtension class to create a 
' class that is used to log the SOAP messages transferred for an XML Web
' service method invocation. Whenever this method is invoked on the client
' side, all the SOAP message that are transfered both from the client and 
' the server are written to a log file.
