' This program shows the use of the AddPermission(NetworkAccess, regex) and 
' IsSubset methods of the WebPermission class.
' It creates two WebPermission instances with the Connect access rights for the specified
' URIs. The second URI being a subset of the first one.
' Then the IsSubsetOf method is called to verify that the second URI is indeed a subset
' of the firts one. The result of the call to the IsSubsetOf is then displayed.
