 ' This program demonstrates the contructor 'Authorization(string,bool,string)' of the authorization 
' * class.
' * 
' * We implement the interface "IAuthenticationModule" to make CloneBasic which is a custom authentication module.
' * The custom authentication module encodes username and password as base64 strings and then returns 
' * back an authorization instance. This authorization is internally used by the HttpWebRequest for 
' * authentication.
' * * 
' * Please Note : This program has to be compiled as a dll.
