' This is a client program to test the "CloneBasic" class of IAuthenticationModule_Methods_Props.dll.
'   
'  To demonstrate the functionality of CloneBasic, Client class has been made which makes
'  the webrequest for the protected resource. A site for such a protected resource (http://gopik/clonebasicsite/WebForm1.aspx),
'  which would use CloneBasic authentication, has been developed. Pl. see the guidelines.txt file for more 
'  information in setting up the site at your environment. 
' 
'  While running this program make sure to refer the 'Authorization_Construstor3.dll'
