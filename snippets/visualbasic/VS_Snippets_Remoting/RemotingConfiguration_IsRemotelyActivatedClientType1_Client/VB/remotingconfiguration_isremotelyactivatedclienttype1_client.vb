' System.Runtime.Remoting.RemotingConfiguration.IsRemotelyActivatedClientType(Type)
'
' The following example demonstrates the 'IsRemotelyActivatedClientType(Type)' method
' of 'RemotingConfiguration' class. 
' It registers a 'TcpChannel' object with the channel services. Then registers the 'MyServerImpl'
' object as activated client type which can be activated at the server. By using the above 
' method it gets the activated client type registered at the client side and displays it's 
' properties to the console.
