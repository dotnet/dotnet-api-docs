' This example shows how to use the ServicePoint and ServicePointManager classes.
' The ServicePointManager class uses the ServicePoint class to manage connections
' to a remote host. The networking classes reuse service points for all 
' requests to a given URI. In fact, the same ServicePoint object 
' is used to issue requests to Internet resources identified by the same
' scheme identifier (for example,  HTTP) and host fragment (for example,  www.contoso.com).  
' Reusing service points in this way can help improve application  performance.
