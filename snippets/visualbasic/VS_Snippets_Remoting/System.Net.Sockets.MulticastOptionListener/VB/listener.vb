' This is the listener example that shows how to use the MulticastOption class. 
' In particular, it shows how to use the MulticastOption(IPAddress, IPAddress) 
' constructor, which you need to use if you have a host with more than one 
' network card.
' The first parameter specifies the multicast group address, and the second 
' specifies the local address of the network card you want to use for the data
' exchange.
' You must run this program in conjunction with the sender program as 
' follows:
' Open a console window and run the listener from the command line. 
' In another console window run the sender. In both cases you must specify 
' the local IPAddress to use. To obtain this address run the ipconfig command 
' from the command line.
