' System.Web.Services.Protocols.SoapExtensionAttribute.Priority

'  The following example demonstrates the 'ExtensionType'
'  and 'Priority' attribute of the 'SoapExtensionAttribute' class.
'  The program extends the 'SoapExtension' class to create a class
'  that is used to log the SOAP messages transferred for a web service
'  method invocation. To associate this 'SoapExtension' class with the
'  web service method on the client proxy, a class that extends from
'  'SoapExtensionAttribute' is used. This 'SoapExtensionAttribute'
'  is applied to a client proxy method which is associated with a
'  web service method. Whenever this method is invoked on the client
'  side all the SOAP message that get transffered both from the client
'  and the server(which is hosting the web service) are written into
'  a log file.
