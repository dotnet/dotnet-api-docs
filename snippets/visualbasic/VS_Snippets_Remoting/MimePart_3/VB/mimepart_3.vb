'   The following program demonstrates the 'MimePart' class, constructor 
'   and 'Extensions' property of 'MimePart' class. It reads 
'   'MimePart_3_Input_vb.wsdl' file which does not have 'MimePart' object
'   supporting 'OutPut' of 'HttpPost'. It adds the 'MimePart' and finally 
'   writes into 'MimePart_3_OutPut_vb.wsdl' file.
