' System.Web.Services.Description.SoapFaultBinding

' The following example demonstrates 'SoapFaultBinding' class. 
' It creates an instance of 'ServiceDescription' class by reading  an existing 
' wsdl file. Then it creates an instance of 'SoapFaultBinding' and adds it to 
' the collection object of 'Binding' class. It generates a new wsdl file where 
' the properties of 'SoapFaultBinding' objects are reflected and which could be
' used for generating a proxy.
