' System.Runtime.Remoting.WellKnownClientTypeEntry

' The following example demonstrates the 'WellKnownClientTypeEntry' class. 
' It registers a 'HttpChannel' object with the channel services. Then registers the 'HelloServer'
' type as well known type with the Remoting Infrastructure at the client end and activates the 
' remote object. It displays the properties of the 'WellKnownClientTypeEntry' object holding the
' values for the above well-known type and makes few method calls on the remote object.
