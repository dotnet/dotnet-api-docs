' This example shows how to join a multicast group and perform a muticast 
' data exchange. The OriginatorClient object starts the conversation while 
' the TargetClient responds. The two helper objects Receive and Send 
' perform the actual data exchange. 
' Note. This program cannot be build with the current VS build version.
' Build it via command line. Rubuild it in VS when a suitable version is
