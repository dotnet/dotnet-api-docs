' This snippet demonstrates HttpChannel.ChannelSinkChain.
' client code should NOT call this call directly. So, I'm
' writing a class that implements the member as HttpChannel
' does. That is, it returns the first sink after the transport
' sink. ie... if the sink chain is transport=>encryption=>formatter
' then this member should return encryption.
