' The following example demonstrates the usage of the
' 'OperationBindingCollection' class, the 'Item' property and various methods of the
' class. The input to the program is a WSDL file 'MathService_input_cs.wsdl' without
' the add operation binding of SOAP protocol. In this example the WSDL file
' is modified to insert a new 'OperationBinding' for SOAP. The
' 'OperationBindingCollection' is populated based on WSDL document
' structure defined in WSDL specification. The updated instance is then
' written to 'MathService_new_cs.wsdl'.
