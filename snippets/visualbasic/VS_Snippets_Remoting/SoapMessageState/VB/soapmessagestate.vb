'  The following example demonstrates the 'AfterDeserialize',
'  'AfterSerialize', 'BeforeDeserialize' and 'BeforeSerialize' enum 
'  members of the 'SoapMessageState' class. The program extends the 
'  'SoapExtension' class to create a class that is used to log the 
'  SOAP messages transferred for a web service method invocation. 
'  To associate this 'SoapExtension' class with the web service 
'  method on the client proxy a class that extends from 
'  'SoapExtensionAttribute' is used. This 'SoapExtensionAttribute' is 
'  applied to a client proxy method which is associated with a web 
'  service method. Whenever this method is invoked on the client
'  side all the SOAP message that get transfered both from the client
'  and the server(which is hosting the web service) are written into
'  a log file.
