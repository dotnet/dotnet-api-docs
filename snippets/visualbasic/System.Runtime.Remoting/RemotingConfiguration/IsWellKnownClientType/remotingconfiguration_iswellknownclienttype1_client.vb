' System.Runtime.Remoting.RemotingConfiguration.IsWellKnownClientType(Type)
'
' The following example demonstrates the 'IsWellKnownClientType(Type)' method
' of 'RemotingConfiguration' class. It registers a 'TcpChannel' object with the channel
' services. Then registers the 'MyServerImpl' object as well-known type. By using the above 
' method it gets the well-known type registered at the client side and displays it's 
' properties to the console.
