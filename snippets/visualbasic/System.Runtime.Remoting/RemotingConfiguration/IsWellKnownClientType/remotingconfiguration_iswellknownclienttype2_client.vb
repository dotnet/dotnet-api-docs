' System.Runtime.Remoting.RemotingConfiguration.IsWellKnownClientType(String,String)

' The following example demonstrates the 'IsWellKnownClientType(String,String)' method
' of 'RemotingConfiguration' class. It registers a 'TcpChannel' object with the channel
' services. Then registers the 'MyServerImpl' object as well-known type at the client end.
' and displays it's properties to the console.
