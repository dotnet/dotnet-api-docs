 ' System.Runtime.Remoting.RemotingServices.GetLifetimeService
' This sample is of a remote client for a group coffee timer.
' Since the client must stay connected to a stateful server object
' for minutes without calling it, it needs to register as a sponsor
' of the lease to prevent the server from being collected.
' Multiple clients can connect to the same timer object, and receive
' notification when the timer expires.
