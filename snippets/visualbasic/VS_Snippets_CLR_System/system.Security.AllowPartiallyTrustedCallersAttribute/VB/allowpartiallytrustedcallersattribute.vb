' To run this test control you must create a strong name key, snkey.snk, and 
' a code group that gives full trust to assemblies signed with snkey.snk.
' The user control displays an OpenFileDialog box, then displays a text box containing the name of 
' the file selected and a list box that displays the contents of the file.  The selected file must 
' contain text in order for the control to display the data properly.
' Caution  This sample demonstrates the use of the Assert method.  Calling Assert removes the 
' requirement that all code in the call chain must be granted permission to access the specified 
' resource, it can open up security vulnerabilities if used incorrectly or inappropriately. Therefore, 
' it should be used with great caution.  Assert should always be followed with a RevertAssert 
' command to restore the security settings.
