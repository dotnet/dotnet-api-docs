' This example shows how a named mutex is used to signal between
' processes or threads.
' Run this program from two (or more) command windows. Each process
' creates a Mutex object that represents the named mutex "MyMutex".
' The named mutex is a system object whose lifetime is bounded by the
' lifetimes of the Mutex objects that represent it. The named mutex
' is created when the first process creates its local Mutex; in this
' example, the named mutex is owned by the first process. The named 
' mutex is destroyed when all the Mutex objects that represent it
' have been released. 
' The second process (and any subsequent process) waits for earlier
' processes to release the named mutex.
