' The following code example shows how the result of GetWeekOfYear varies depending on the FirstDayOfWeek and the CalendarWeekRule used.
' If the specified date is the last day of the year, GetWeekOfYear returns the total number of weeks in that year.

'This code produces the following output.  Results vary depending on the system date.
'
'The CalendarWeekRule used for the en-US culture is FirstDay.
'The FirstDayOfWeek used for the en-US culture is Sunday.
'Therefore, the current week is Week 1 of the current year.
'There are 53 weeks in the current year (2001).
