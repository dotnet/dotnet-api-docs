' System.Configuration.Install.InstallException
' System.Configuration.Install.InstallException.InstallException()
' System.Configuration.Install.InstallException.InstallException(String, Exception)
' System.Configuration.Install.InstallException.InstallException(String)

' The following example demonstrates the 'InstallException()', 'InstallException(String)'
' and 'InstallException(String, Exception)' constructors for 'InstallException' class.
' This example shows an assembly having its own installer named 'MyInstaller'
' which has an attribute 'RunInstallerAttribute', indicating that this installer
' will be invoked by InstallUtil.exe. InstallUtil.exe calls the 'Install', 'Commit',
' 'Rollback' and 'Uninstall' methods. The code in 'Commit' method presumes that 
' a file named 'FileDoesNotExist.txt' exists before the installation of the 
' assembly can be committed. If the file 'FileDoesNotExist.txt' does not exist
' 'Commit' raises a 'InstallException'. Same is the case with 'Uninstall', 
' uninstalltion will only progress if the file named 'FileDoesNotExist.txt' 
' exists else it raises an 'InstallException'. In 'Rollback' some piece of
' code is executed which may raise an exception. If the exception is raised then
' it is caught and an 'InstallException' is raised with that exception being passed
' to it.

' Note : Run this example with the help of 'InstallUtil.exe'
'       InstallUtil InstallException.exe
'       InstallUtil /u InstallException.exe
