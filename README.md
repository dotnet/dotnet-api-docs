# .NET API Reference Docs

This repository contains documentation for the .NET API reference. We track all work for this repository using [GitHub issues](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-api-docs/issues). The documentation for APIs is built from the text and code snippets in this repo, and from the samples in the [dotnet/samples](https://github.com/dotnet/samples) repository.

The repository for conceptual .NET documentation is the [dotnet/docs repository](https://github.com/dotnet/docs).

## :purple_heart: Contribute

We welcome contributions to help us improve and complete the .NET API reference docs.

To contribute, see:

- The [.NET Contributor Guide :ledger:](https://learn.microsoft.com/contribute/dotnet/dotnet-contribute) for instructions on procedures we use.
- Issues labeled [`help wanted` :label:](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-api-docs/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22+) for ideas.
- The API reference docs for some assemblies are maintained in the assembly's source code outside this repo. Edits to the XML here are auto-generated and ported, so docs for APIs in those assemblies should be updated by editing the source code comments. See [here](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/docs/adding-api-guidelines.md#documentation) for details.
