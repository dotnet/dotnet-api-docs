# Field Value Subsection

The Field Value subsection describes the value of a field. In DxEditor, use the Return Value section for the field value description.

Providing a Field Value description is optional. If no description is authored, the subsection does not appear in the build.

If you do include this section, follow the guidelines in [Property Value Subsection](properties.md) to describe the field value.
