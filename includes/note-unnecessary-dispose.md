> [!NOTE]
> This type implements the <xref:System.IDisposable> interface, but does not actually have any resources to dispose. This means that disposing it by directly calling <xref:System.IDisposable.Dispose> or by using a language construct such as `using` (in C#) or `Using` (in Visual Basic) is not necessary.
