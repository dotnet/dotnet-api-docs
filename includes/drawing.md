> [!CAUTION]
> The `System.Drawing` namespace has some limitations for certain operating systems and application types.
>
> - On Windows, `System.Drawing` depends on the GDI+ native library, which is shipped as part of the OS. Some Windows SKUs, like Windows Server Core or Windows Nano, don't include this native library as part of the OS. If you use this namespace and the library can't be loaded, exceptions will be thrown at run time.
>
> - Some types in the `System.Drawing` namespace rely on [GDI+](/windows/win32/gdiplus/-gdiplus-gdi-start), which is not supported in Windows services and ASP.NET Core and ASP.NET apps. These types are in the [System.Drawing.Common](https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Drawing.Common/) NuGet package and include <xref:System.Drawing.Bitmap?displayProperty=fullName> and <xref:System.Drawing.Font?displayProperty=fullName>. However, primitive types in the namespace, such as <xref:System.Drawing.Color?displayProperty=fullName>, <xref:System.Drawing.Size?displayProperty=fullName>, <xref:System.Drawing.Point?displayProperty=fullName>, and <xref:System.Drawing.Rectangle?displayProperty=fullName>, can be used in any application.
>
> - The [System.Drawing.Common](https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Drawing.Common/) NuGet package works on Windows, Linux, and macOS. However, there are some platform differences. On Linux and macOS, the GDI+ functionality is implemented by the [libgdiplus](https://www.mono-project.com/docs/gui/libgdiplus/) library. This library is not installed by default in most Linux distributions and doesn't support all the functionality of GDI+ on Windows and macOS. There are also platforms where libgdiplus is not available at all. To use types from the System.Drawing.Common package on Linux and macOS, you must install libgdiplus separately. For more information, see [Install .NET on Linux](/dotnet/core/install/linux) or [Install .NET on macOS](/dotnet/core/install/macos#libgdiplus).

> If you can't use `System.Drawing` with your application, recommended alternatives include [ImageSharp](https://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp), [SkiaSharp](https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp), and [Windows Imaging Components](/windows/desktop/wic/-wic-about-windows-imaging-codec).
