> [!CAUTION]
> - The `System.Drawing` namespace is not recommended for new development, because it's not supported within Windows services, ASP.NET Core, and ASP.NET. Attempting to use `System.Drawing` classes within one of these application types may result in run-time exceptions and diminished service performance. Recommended alternatives include [ImageSharp](https://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp), [SkiaSharp](https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp), and [Windows Imaging Components](/windows/desktop/wic/-wic-about-windows-imaging-codec).
> - On Windows, `System.Drawing` depends on the GDI+ native library, which is shipped as part of the OS. Some Windows SKUs, like Windows Server Core or Windows Nano, don't include this native library as part of the OS. Exceptions will be thrown at run time because the library can't be loaded.
