> [!IMPORTANT]
>  When rounding midpoint values, the rounding algorithm performs an equality test. Because of problems of binary representation and precision in the floating-point format, the value returned by the method can be unexpected. For more information, see ["Rounding and precision"](xref:System.Math.Round%2A#rounding-and-precision).
