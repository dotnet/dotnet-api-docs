However, when calling the `String.Format` method, it's not necessary to focus on the particular overload that you want to call. Instead, you can call the method with a [composite format string](/dotnet/standard/base-types/composite-formatting) that includes one or more format items. You assign each format item a numeric index; the first index starts at 0. In addition to the initial string, your method call should have as many additional arguments as it has index values. For example, a string whose format items have indexes of 0 and 1 should have 2 arguments; one with indexes 0 through 5 should have 6 arguments. The language compiler will then resolve your method call to a particular overload of the `String.Format` method.

For more detailed documentation on using the `String.Format` method, see [Get started with the String.Format method](/dotnet/fundamentals/runtime-libraries/system-string-format#get-started-with-the-stringformat-method) and [Which method do I call?](/dotnet/fundamentals/runtime-libraries/system-string-format#which-method-do-i-call).
