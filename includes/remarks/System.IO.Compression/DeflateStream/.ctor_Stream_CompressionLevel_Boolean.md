You use this constructor when you want to specify whether compression efficiency or speed is more important for an instance of the <xref:System.IO.Compression.DeflateStream> class, and whether to leave the stream object open after disposing the <xref:System.IO.Compression.DeflateStream> object.

This constructor overload uses the compression mode <xref:System.IO.Compression.CompressionMode.Compress>. To set the compression mode to another value, use the <xref:System.IO.Compression.DeflateStream.%23ctor%28System.IO.Stream%2CSystem.IO.Compression.CompressionMode%29> or <xref:System.IO.Compression.DeflateStream.%23ctor%28System.IO.Stream%2CSystem.IO.Compression.CompressionMode%2CSystem.Boolean%29> overload.

## Examples

The following example shows how to set the compression level when creating a <xref:System.IO.Compression.DeflateStream> object and how to leave the stream open.
