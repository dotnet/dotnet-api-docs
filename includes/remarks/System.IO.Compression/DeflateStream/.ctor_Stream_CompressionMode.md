By default, <xref:System.IO.Compression.DeflateStream> owns the underlying stream, so closing the stream also closes the underlying stream. Note that the state of the underlying stream can affect the usability of the stream. Also, no explicit checks are performed, so no additional exceptions are thrown when the new instance is created.

If an instance of the <xref:System.IO.Compression.DeflateStream> class is created with the `mode` parameter equal to `Compress`, header information is inserted immediately. If no further action occurs, the stream appears as a valid, empty, compressed file.

Using the <xref:System.IO.Compression.DeflateStream> class to compress a file larger than 4 GB raises an exception.

By default, the compression level is set to <xref:System.IO.Compression.CompressionLevel.Optimal> when the compression mode is <xref:System.IO.Compression.CompressionMode.Compress>.

## Examples

The following example shows how to use the <xref:System.IO.Compression.DeflateStream> class to compress and decompress a file.
